<section>
  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Cookies are an HTTP state management mechanism that web developers rely on
  heavily for important things like authentication. They are also quite fragile,
  and have scoping rules that don't mesh well with the <a>origin</a> model that
  developers are familiar with. Cookies flow freely between
  <a for="URL" attribute>scheme</a>s by default, can be set from subdomains or
  limited to paths, and ignore <a for="URL" attribute>port</a>s entirely. The
  disconnect between cookies and other types of storage opens up a number of
  risks that are difficult to fully mitigate. See [[YUMMY-COOKIES]] for some
  real-world examples of problems that have cropped up in the past.

  This document defines mechanisms which allow developers to limit the ways in
  which cookies can be set for a given <a>protected resource</a>.

  Note: [[ORIGIN-COOKIES]] could resolve some of the issues here in a different
  way, but it's unclear if those will ever be adopted.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. hosts a number of pages which have no real need to write
    cookies. Following the principle of least privilege, the clever developers
    responsible for those pages send the following headers along with every HTTP
    response, ensuring that no cookies can be set via `Set-Cookie` or
    `document.cookie`:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>cookie-scope</a> <a grammar>none</a>
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. hosts a number of pages on `http://non-secure.example.com`
    which need to write cookies, but don't need those cookies to span
    subdomains. The following header ensures that cookies can only be set via
    `Set-Cookie` or `document.cookie` if those cookies are "host only" (e.g. the
    cookie's `domain` attribute is empty):

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>cookie-scope</a> <a grammar>host</a>
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. hosts a number of pages on `https://secure.example.com`
    which need to write cookies, but don't need those cookies to span
    subdomains. They'll certainly set the <a grammar>host</a> property, just
    like the previous example, but since this is a secure site, they also wish
    to ensure that any cookies they set also contain the `secure` attribute.
    They can do so with the following header:

    <pre>
      <a>Content-Security-Policy</a>: <a>cookie-scope</a> <a grammar>host</a> <a grammar>secure</a>
    </pre>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Big Text: DIRECTIVE -->
<section>
  <h2 id="cookie-scope-directive">The `cookie-scope` directive</h2>

  <dfn export>`cookie-scope`</dfn> is a Content Security Policy
  <a>directive</a> [[!CSP]] which restricts the scope in which <a>cookies</a>
  [[!RFC6265]] can be set. The syntax is described by the following ABNF
  grammar:

  <pre link-type="grammar" dfn-type="grammar">
    directive-name = "cookie-scope"
    directive-value = <a>scoping-rules</a> *( <a>RWS</a> <a>scoping-rules</a> )
    <dfn>scoping-rules</dfn> = "<dfn>host</dfn>" / "<dfn>none</dfn>" / "<dfn>secure</dfn>"
  </pre>

  ISSUE: Erik Nygren
  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2013Sep/0046.html">proposed</a>
  adding `path` restrictions as well. Is that worthwhile?

  <h3 id="monkey-patching-rfc6264">Enforcement and Monitoring</h3>

  After step 10 of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.3">the
  storage algorithm in Section 5.3 of RFC 6265</a>, a cookie object has been
  built. Insert the following validation steps before proceeding to the current
  step 11:

  <ol start="11">
    <li>
      If [[#block-cookie]] returns "`Blocked`" when executed upon
      <var>cookie</var> and the <a>incumbent settings object</a>,
      abort these steps without modifying the <a>cookie store</a>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  ISSUE: Monkey patching! Hey, maybe it's time to reopen that cookie RFC after
  all, eh @mnot? :)

  <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

  <h3 id="block-cookie">
    Is <var>cookie</var> blocked for <var>settings object</var>?
  </h3>

  Given a <a>cookie</a> (<var>cookie</var>), and an <a>environment settings
  object</a> (<var>settings</var>), this algorithm returns "`Allowed`" if
  <var>cookie</var> can be written, and "`Blocked`" if it violates one or
  more of <var>settings</var>'s enforced Content Security Policies:

  1.  Let <var>status</var> be "`Allowed`".

  2.  For each <var>policy</var> in <var>settings</var>'s <a>monitored Content
      Security Policies</a>:

      1.  If [[#violates]] returns "`Violates`" when executed upon the cookie
          and <var>policy</var>, <a>report a violation</a>.

          Note: We do <em>not</em> touch <var>status</var> here, as we're
          only evaluating the monitored policies.

  2.  For each <var>policy</var> in <var>settings</var>'s <a>enforced Content
      Security Policies</a>:

      1.  If [[#violates]] returns "`Violates`" when executed upon the cookie
          and <var>policy</var>, <a>report a violation</a>, and set
          <var>status</var> to "`Blocked`":

  3.  Return <var>status</var>.

  <h3 id="violates">
    Does <var>cookie</var> violate <var>policy</var>?
  </h3>

  1.  Let <var>scope</var> be the value of <var>policy</var>'s
      <a>cookie-scope</a> directive.

  2.  If any of the following conditions are met, return "`Violates`":

      1.  <var>scope</var> contains "<a grammar>host</a>", and the cookie's
          `host-only-flag` is `false`.

      2.  <var>scope</var> contains "<a grammar>none</a>".

      3.  <var>scope</var> contains "<a grammar>secure</a>", and the
          cookie's `secure-only-flag` is `false`.

  3.  Return "`Does not violate`".
