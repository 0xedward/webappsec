Content Security Policy
=======================

This repository is a fork of the Web Application Security WG's official
[mercurial repository][1]. The `w3c` branch tracks that repository's
status, while I'm puttering away on the `master` branch.

`csp-1.0-specification.html` is, as you might expect, the final 1.0 document
(<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/>), which was forked off in
27a274ff48b6dcf0af50938d39373d60f797bb8f.

CSP 1.1 is being specified in `csp-specification.dev.html`.
