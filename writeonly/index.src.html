  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  A user's credentials are valuable, and are often the key target of phishing
  and content injection attacks.

  Users can defend themselves from the former threat by using a credential
  manager which enables the generation of strong, unique passwords for all the
  sites they visit, and which only provides those credentials to the website
  they're tied to. If a user relies on a credential manager to keep track of her
  passwords, and the credential manager refuses to fill them into forms on
  unexpected origins, phishing becomes significantly more difficult.

  Content injection, on the other hand, can turn the credential manager against
  the user, as demonstrated in "Automated Password Extraction Attack on Modern
  Password Managers" [[LUPIN]]. If an attacker can inject a form into a website
  and the credential manager can be tricked into filling it, the user's
  credentials will be available to the attacker directly via DOM APIs or
  indirectly via form submission to a malicious endpoint. The latter risk can be
  mitigated via the Content Security Policy <code>form-action</code> directive
  [[!CSP2]], but the former is a real problem. If passwords are a simple "value"
  accessor away, users are at risk.

  It is tempting to simply block read access to password fields, but many
  websites do interesting things with password fields. They may read the values
  in order to sign a user in via XMLHttpRequest, for instance, rather than
  submitting a form. A blanket restriction is unlikely to be web-compatible.

  Instead, this document proposes an opt-in mechanism by which a website can
  choose to deny itself read access to the values of particular form fields.

  <h2 id="prevent-dom-access">Preventing DOM access to form fields</h2>

  Developers may opt-into preventing DOM access to form fields by setting a
  <code><a element-attr>writeonly</a></code> attribute on specific
  <a element>input</a> elements, or by using the <code><a>credentials</a></code>
  Content Security Policy directive to prevent DOM access to any and all
  <a element>input</a> elements of type
  <code><a element-attr>password</a></code>. Both mechanisms are described
  below:

  <h3 id="writeonly-attribute">The <code>writeonly</code> attribute</h3>

  <code><dfn element-attr>writeonly</dfn></code> is a <a>boolean attribute</a>
  that controls whether or not an <a element>input</a> element's value may be
  read directly via the <a idl for="HTMLInputElement">value</a> IDL attribute,
  or inferred via the
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#the-constraint-validation-api">constraint
  validation API</a> [[!HTML5]]. 

  <pre class="idl">
    partial interface HTMLInputElement {
        attribute boolean writeonly;
    };
  </pre>
  <dl dfn-for="HTMLInputElement">
    <dt><dfn attribute>writeonly</dfn></dt>
    <dd>This attribute <a spec="HTML5">reflects</a> the value of the
    element's <code><a element-attr>writeonly</a></code> content attribute.</dd>
  </dl>

  If the <code>writeonly</code> attribute is set for an <a element>input</a> element
  <var>input</var>, then set <var>input</var>'s <dfn>write-only value flag</dfn>
  to <code>true</code>.

  Note: Removing the <code><a element-attr>writeonly</a></code> attribute will
  not clear an element's <a>write-only value flag</a>. Once that flag is set for
  an element, it cannot be cleared.

  <h3 id="credentials-directive">
    The <code>credentials</code> Content Security Policy directive
  </h3>

  The <code><dfn>credentials</dfn></code> directive specifies a credentials
  policy which affects how the user agent interprets <a element>input</a>
  elements in a protected resource. The syntax for the name and value of the
  directive are described by the following ABNF grammar [[!ABNF]]:

  <pre>
    directive-name  = "credentials"
    directive-value = "writeonly"
  </pre>

  When enforcing the credentials directive, the user agent MUST set the
  protected resource's <dfn>forced write-only password value flag</dfn> to true.

  ISSUE: Perhaps a better model is to define a list of autocomplete types, which
  would allow us to cover things like autofilled credit card numbers. Thread at
  <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014JulSep/0168.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014JulSep/0168.html</a>,
  with a suggestion of <code>form-readonly cc-number cc-csc ... current-password
  new-password</code>.

  <h3 id="input-behavior"><code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element behavior</h3>

  If an <a element>input</a> element <var>input</var>'s <a>write-only value
  flag</a> is <code>true</code>, or if <var>input</var>'s {{Document}}'s
  <a>forced write-only password value flag</a> is <code>true</code>
  <strong>and</strong> <var>input</var>'s
  <code><a idl for="HTMLInputElement">type</a></code> is <code>password</code>, the following
  restrictions apply:

  <ol>
    <li>
      When setting <var>input</var>'s
      <code><a idl for="HTMLInputElement">type</a></code> IDL attribute
      [[!HTML5]], <var>input</var>'s <a>write-only value flag</a> MUST also be
      set to <code>true</code>.

      Note: This prevents attackers from bypassing the CSP directive by changing
      the element's type from <code>password</code> to something unprotected
      (like <code>text</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Getting <var>input</var>'s <a idl for="HTMLInputElement">value</a>,
      <a idl for="HTMLInputElement">valueAsNumber</a>, and
      <a idl for="HTMLInputElement">valueAsDate</a> IDL attributes [[!HTML5]]
      will throw an <code><a>InvalidStateError</a></code> exception. [[!DOM]]
    
      Note: Setting these attributes is unaffected.
    </li>
    <li>
      Getting <var>input</var>'s {{selectionStart}} and {{selectionEnd}} IDL
      attributes [[!HTML5]] will throw an <code><a>InvalidStateError</a></code>
      exception. [[!DOM]]

      Note: Setting these attributes is unaffected.
    </li>
    <li>
      <var>input</var> is considered
      <a title="barred the element from constraint validation">barred from
      constraint validation</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The user agent MUST NOT fire <code>keydown</code>, <code>keyup</code>, or
      <code>keypress</code> events on <var>input</var>. [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]]
    </li>
  </ol>

  ISSUE: Is this more or less exhaustive? I'm sure I'm missing some clever ways
  of reading the value.

  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="security-sandboxing">Sandboxing autofilled credential access</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Some user agents are implemented in such a way as to render websites via
  low-privilege processes that don't have direct access to the network. Network
  requests are mediated by a more privileged parent process, which can protect
  against a number of threats which arise if a clever attacker can exploit bugs
  in the user agent to corrupt the website's process.

  Even if we prevent DOM-level access to input fields, the form field is somehow
  represented in memory that's accessible to that child process. It is quite
  conceivable that an attacker could exploit browser bugs which corrupt the
  child process in such a way as to expose a user's credentials.

  Marking fields as write-only might mitigate this risk in the case of
  autofilled credentials. Since the webpage does not need access to a user's
  actual password, the parent process can generate a nonce when autofilling
  credentials, and ask the child process to fill the password field with that
  value instead of the actual password. Then, when the child process asks the
  parent process to POST a form, the parent process can replace occurrences of
  the nonce in the POST's body with the actual password for a given credential.

  This approach means that the actual credentials are never provided to the
  high-risk child process, which means that an attacker would have to break
  out of the child's sandbox in order to steal credentials.

  A more rigorous examination of this approach is undertaken in "Protecting
  Users Against XSS-based Password Manager Abuse" [[STOCK]]. Their use of a
  browser extension is instructive: there's no reason that this scheme couldn't
  be implemented by a third-party credential manager, as long as it has access
  to the data POSTed from one page to another.

  <h2 id="authoring-considerations">Authoring Considerations</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  In order to mitigate the risk of content injection attacks which steal user
  credentials, we recommend that authors:

  <ol>
    <li>
      Set a Content Security Policy [[!CSP2]] on every page of their sites
      (including error pages, etc.), and ensure that the policy contains both
      <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/content-security-policy/#directive-form-action">form-action</a></code>
      and <code><a>credentials</a></code> directives. The former will protect
      against autofilled form submissions which exfiltrate data to an attacker's
      origin, the latter against DOM-level content injection attacks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always place sign-in forms on TLS-protected pages, and always submit such
      forms to TLS-protected endpoints. If credentials are sent in the clear,
      they are trivially vulnerable to theft.
    </li>
  </ol>
