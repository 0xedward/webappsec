      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>This document defines Content Security Policy, a mechanism web
      applications can use to mitigate a broad class of content injection
      vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). Content Security
      Policy is a declarative policy that lets the authors (or server
      administrators) of a web application inform the client about the sources
      from which the application expects to load resources.</p>

      <p>To mitigate XSS attacks, for example, a web application can declare
      that it only expects to load script from specific, trusted sources. This
      declaration allows the client to detect and block malicious scripts
      injected into the application by an attacker.</p>

      <p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is not intended as a first line of
      defense against content injection vulnerabilities. Instead, CSP is best
      used as defense-in-depth, to reduce the harm caused by content injection
      attacks.</p>

      <p>There is often a non-trivial amount of work required to apply CSP to
      an existing web application. To reap the greatest benefit, authors will
      need to move all inline script and style out-of-line, for example into
      external scripts, because the user agent cannot determine whether an
      inline script was injected by an attacker.</p>

      <p>To take advantage of CSP, a web application opts into using CSP by
      supplying a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> HTTP header. Such
      policies apply to the current resource representation only. To supply a
      policy for an entire site, the server needs to supply a policy with each
      resource representation.</p>

    <section id="conformance">
      <p>Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as
      "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these
      steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("MUST",
      "SHOULD", "MAY", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.</p>

      <p>A <dfn>conformant user agent</dfn> MUST implement all the
      requirements listed in this specification that are applicable to
      user-agents.

      <p>A <dfn>conformant server</dfn> MUST implement all the requirements
      listed in this specification that are applicable to servers.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Key Concepts and Terminology</h3>

        <p>This section defines several terms used throughout the document.</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>security policy</dfn>, or simply <dfn>policy</dfn>, for
        the purposes of this specification refers to either:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>a set of security preferences for restrictions within which the
          content can operate, or</li>
          <li>a fragment of text that codifies these preferences.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The security policies defined by this document are applied by a
        user agent on a <em>per-resource representation basis</em>.
        Specifically, when a user agent receives a policy along with the
        representation of a given resource, that policy applies to <em>that
        resource representation only</em>. This document often refers to
        that resource representation as the <dfn>protected resource</dfn>.

        <p>A server transmits its security policy for a particular protected
        resource as a collection of <dfn>directives</dfn>, such as
        <code>default-src 'self'</code>, each of which declares a specific set
        of restrictions for that resource as instantiated by the user agent.
        More details are provided in the <a href="#directives">directives</a>
        section.</p>

        <p>A directive consists of a <dfn>directive name</dfn>, which
        indicates the privileges controlled by the directive, and a
        <dfn>directive value</dfn>, which specifies the restrictions the
        policy imposes on those privileges.</p>

        <p>The term <dfn id="origin">origin</dfn> is defined in the Origin specification. [[!RFC6454]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>globally unique identifier</dfn> is defined in section 4 of the Origin specification. [[!RFC6454]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>URI</dfn> is defined in the URI specification.  [[!URI]]</p>

        <p>The term <dfn>resource representation</dfn> is defined in the HTTP 1.1 specification.  [[!HTTP11]]</p>

        <p>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;object&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;embed&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;track&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;applet&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>
        and <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> elements are defined in the HTML5 specification. [[!HTML5]]</p>

        <p>A <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#plugin">plugin</a> is defined
        in the HTML5 specification. [[!HTML5]]</p>

        <p>The <code>@font-face</code> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rule is defined in the
        CSS Fonts Module Level 3 specification. [[!CSS3FONT]]</p>

        <p>The <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object is defined in the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>
        specification. [[!XMLHTTPREQUEST]]</p>

        <p>The <code>WebSocket</code> object is defined in the <code>WebSocket</code>
        specification. [[!WEBSOCKETS]]</p>

        <p>The <code>EventSource</code> object is defined in the <code>EventSource</code>
        specification. [[!EVENTSOURCE]]</p>

        <p>The Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation used in this
        document is specified in RFC 5234. [[!ABNF]]</p>

        <p>This document also uses the ABNF extension "#rule" as defined in HTTP 1.1. [[!HTTP11]]</p>

        <p>The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
        [<em><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234#appendix-B.1">ABNF Appendix B.1</a></em>]:
        <code>ALPHA</code> (letters), <code>DIGIT</code> (decimal
        0-9), <code>WSP</code> (white space) and <code>VCHAR</code> (printing
        characters).</p>

      <h2>Framework</h2>

      <p>This section defines the general framework for content security
      policies, including the delivery mechanisms and general syntax for
      policies. The next section contains the details of the specific
      directives introduced in this specification.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Policy Delivery</h3>

        <p>The server delivers the policy to the user agent via an HTTP
        response header.</p>

        <section>
          <h4><code>Content-Security-Policy</code> Header Field</h4>

          <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field is the
          preferred mechanism for delivering a CSP policy.</p>

<pre>
"Content-Security-Policy:" 1#policy
</pre>

          <p>A server MAY send more than one HTTP header field named
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> with a given resource
          representation.</p>

          <p>A server MAY send different <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
          header field values with different representations of the same
          resource or with different resources.</p>

          <p>Upon receiving an HTTP response containing at least one
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field, the user agent
          MUST <a href="#enforce">enforce</a> each of the policies contained
          in each such header field.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4><code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> Header Field</h4>

          <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field
          lets servers experiment with policies by monitoring (rather than
          enforcing) a policy.</p>

<pre>
"Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only:" 1#policy
</pre>

          <p>For example, a server operators might wish to develop their
          security policy iteratively. The operators can deploy a report-only
          policy based on their best estimate of how their site behaves. If
          their site violates this policy, instead of breaking the site, the
          user agent will send violation reports to a URI specified in the
          policy. Once a site has confidence that the policy is appropriate,
          they start enforcing the policy using the
          <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header field.</p>

          <p>A server MAY send more than one HTTP header field named
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> with a given
          resource representation.</p>

          <p>A server MAY send different
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field values
          with different representations of the same resource or with different
          resources.</p>

          <p>Upon receiving an HTTP response containing at least one
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header field, the
          user agent MUST <a href="#monitor">monitor</a> each of the policies
          contained in each such header field.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>HTML <code>meta</code> Element (Experimental)</h4>

          <p>The server MAY supply a CSP policy in an HTML <code>meta</code>
          element with an <code>http-equiv</code> attribute that is a case
          insensitive match for either <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> or
          <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code>.</p>

          <p>Add the following entries to the <a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics.html#pragma-directives">pragma
          directives</a> for the <code>meta</code> element:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt>Content security policy (<code>http-equiv="content-security-policy"</code>)</dt>
            <dd>
              <ol>
                <li>If the user agent is already enforcing a CSP policy for the
                document, abort these steps.</li>

                <li>If the <code>meta</code> element lacks a
                <code>content</code> attribute, abort these steps.</li>

                <li><a href="#enforce">Enforce</a> the CSP policy contained in
                the <code>content</code> attribute of the <code>meta</code>
                element.</li>
              </ol>
            </dd>

            <dt>Content security policy, report only (<code>http-equiv="content-security-policy-report-only"</code>)</dt>
            <dd>
              <ol>
                <li>If the user agent is already monitoring a CSP policy for
                the document, abort these steps.</li>

                <li>If the <code>meta</code> element lacks a
                <code>content</code> attribute, abort these steps.</li>

                <li><a href="#monitor">Monitor</a> the CSP policy contained in
                the <code>content</code> attribute of the <code>meta</code>
                element.</li>
              </ol>
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>As a consequence of these requirements, a policy supplied in an
          HTTP header field takes precedence over policies supplied in
          <code>meta</code> elements. Similarly, the above requirements entail
          that the first <code>meta</code> element containing a policy takes
          precedence over policies supplied in subsequent <code>meta</code>
          elements.</p>

          <p><em>TODO: Turn the bullets below into actual spec text.</em>
          <ul>
              <li>In order to work, the <code>meta</code> element needs to be
              in document's head. This requirement makes it harder for folks to
              inject CSP policies into vulnerable documents.</li>

              <li>Ignore the <code>report-uri</code> directive in CSP policies
              obtained from <code>meta</code> elements. This requirement
              mitigates one attack that might result from an injected policy.
              It also provides a carrot for supplying the policy in an HTTP
              header, which is better for security.</li>

              <li>Add some guidance that sites should put the <code>meta</code>
              element as early as possible in their document to reduce the risk
              of an attacker injecting another policy in front.</li>

              <li>Ignore policies from <code>meta</code> elements that get
              inserted after the document's readyState reaches "interactive".
              This requirement further mitigates the risk of the
              <code>meta</code> element being injected.  (Is this requirement
              still useful in light of the above mitigations?)</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Enforcing multiple policies.</h4>
          <p>The above sections note that when multiple policies are present,
          each must be enforced or reported, according to its type. An example
          will help clarify how that ought to work in practice. The behavior of
          an <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> might seem unclear given a site
          that, for whatever reason, delivered the following HTTP headers:</p>
          <pre>
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' http://example.com http://example.net;
                         connect-src 'none';
Content-Security-Policy: connect-src http://example.com/;
                         script-src http://example.com/
          </pre>
          <p>Is a connection to <code>example.com</code> allowed or not? The
          short answer is that the connection is not allowed. Enforcing both
          policies means that a potential connection would have to pass through
          both unscathed. Even though the second policy would allow this
          connection, the first policy contains <code>connect-src 'none'</code>,
          so its enforcement blocks the connection. The impact is that adding
          additional policies to the list of policies to enforce can only
          further restrict the capabilities of the protected resource.</p>
          <p>To demonstrate that further, consider a script tag on this page.
          The first policy would lock scripts down to <code>'self'</code>,
          <code>http://example.com</code> and <code>http://example.net</code>
          via the <code>default-src</code> directive. The second, however, would
          only allow script from <code>http://example.com/</code>. Script will
          only load if it meets both policy's criteria: in this case, the only
          origin that can match is <code>http://example.com</code>, as both
          policies allow it.</p>

              <h6>Path Matching</h6>

              <p>The rules for matching source expressions that contain paths
              are simpler than they look: paths that end with the '/' character
              match all files in a directory and its subdirectories. Paths that
              do not end with the '/' character match only one specific file. A
              few examples should make this clear:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The source expression <code>example.com</code> has no path,
                and therefore matches any file served from that host.</li>

                <li>The source expression <code>example.com/scripts/</code>
                matches any file in the <code>scripts</code> directory of
                <code>example.com</code>, and any of its subdirectories. For
                example, both <code>https://example.com/scripts/file.js</code>
                and <code>https://example.com/scripts/js/file.js</code> would
                match.</li>

                <li>The source expression
                <code>example.com/scripts/file.js</code> matches only the file
                named <code>file.js</code> in the <code>scripts</code> directory
                of <code>example.com</code>.</li>

                <li>Likewise, the source expression <code>example.com/js</code>
                matches only the file named <code>js</code>. In particular, note
                that it would not match files inside a directory named
                <code>js</code>. Files like <code>example.com/js/file.js</code>
                would be matched only if the source expression ended with a
                trailing "/", as in <code>example.com/js/</code>.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Note that query strings have no impact on matching: the source
              expression <code>example.com/file?key=value</code> matches all of
              <code>https://example.com/file</code>,
              <code>https://example.com/file?key=value</code>,
              <code>https://example.com/file?key=notvalue</code>, and

        <h3>Processing Model</h3>

        <p>To <dfn id="enforce">enforce</dfn> a CSP policy, the user agent MUST
        <a href="#parse-a-csp-policy">parse the policy</a> and enforce each of
        the directives contained in the policy, where the specific
        requirements for enforcing each directive are defined separately for
        each directive (See <a href="#sec-directives">Directives</a>,
        below).</p>

        <p>Generally speaking, enforcing a directive prevents the protected
        resource from performing certain actions, such as loading scripts from
        URIs other than those indicated in a source list. These restrictions
        make it more difficult for an attacker to abuse an injection
        vulnerability in the resource because the attacker will be unable to
        usurp the resource's privileges that have been restricted in this
        way.</p>

        <p>Enforcing a CSP policy SHOULD NOT interfere with the operation of
        user-supplied scripts such as third-party user-agent add-ons and
        JavaScript bookmarklets.</p>

        <p>To <dfn id="monitor">monitor</dfn> a CSP policy, the user agent MUST
        <a href="#parse-a-csp-policy">parse the policy</a> and monitor each of
        the directives contained in the policy.</p>

        <p>Monitoring a directive does not prevent the protected resource from
        undertaking any actions. Instead, any actions that would have been
        prevented by the directives are instead reported to the developer of
        the web application. Monitoring a CSP policy is useful for testing
        whether enforcing the policy will cause the web application to
        malfunction.</p>

        <p>A server MAY cause user agents to monitor one policy while enforcing
        another policy by returning both <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
        and <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> header fields.
        For example, if a server operator is using one policy but wishes to
        experiment with a stricter policy, the server operator can monitor
        the stricter policy while enforcing the original policy. Once the
        server operator is satisfied that the stricter policy does not break
        the web application, the server operator can start enforcing the
        stricter policy.</p>

        <p>If the user agent monitors or enforces a CSP policy that does not
        contain any directives, the user agent SHOULD report a warning message
        in the developer console.</p>

        <p>If the user agent monitors or enforces a CSP policy that contains
        an unrecognized directive, the user agent SHOULD report a warning
        message in the developer console indicating the name of the
        unrecognized directive.</p>

        <p>Whenever a user agent <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/workers/#run-a-worker">runs a worker</a>:
        [[!WEBWORKERS]]</p>

        <ul>
          <li>If the user agent is enforcing a CSP policy for the <var>owner
          document</var>, the user agent MUST enforce the CSP policy for the
          worker.</li>

          <li>If the user agent is monitoring a CSP policy for the <var>owner
          document</var>, the user agent MUST monitor the CSP policy for the
          worker.</li>

          <h4>Usage</h4>
          <p>The script interface described here serves as a feature detection
          API that developers can use in order to make intelligent decisions
          about code that executes on a page based on the page's active
          policy. This is especially important for developers of libraries or
          frameworks which are meant to be used on a variety of sites in
          unknown contexts.</p>
          <p>A few use-cases follow for illustration:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Does the user agent support CSP?</strong></p>
              <pre>var isCSPSupported = !!document.SecurityPolicy;</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Is a policy active on the current page?</strong> If
              not, perhaps one should be injected via the
              <a href="#html-meta-element--experimental">(experimental)
              <code>meta</code> element</a>.</p>
              <pre>var isCSPActive = document.SecurityPolicy.isActive();</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Can I use <code>new Function();</code> or
              <code>eval()</code>?</strong> Some libraries use these dangerous
              methods for performance optimizations. If they are unavailable,
              the library could gracefully fall back to a less performant (but
              safer) mechanism.</p>
              <pre>var isEvalAvailable = document.SecurityPolicy.allowsEval();</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Can I use <var>library X</var>, hosted on a
              third-party server?</strong> Analytics packages are a good
              example of such third-party packages that a developer might want
              to include if they're allowed. For a library that's hosted on
              <code>https://cdn.example.com/</code> and that includes images
              from <code>https://img.example.com/</code>, the following would
              allow a developer to determine its availability.</p>
              <pre>var isLibraryAvailable = (document.SecurityPolicy.allowsScriptFrom('https://cdn.example.com/path/to/library.js')
                          &amp;&amp; document.SecurityPolicy.allowsImageFrom('https://img.example.com/path/to/img.png'));</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that this interface only provides insight into the origins
          allowed by the page's Content Security Policy. That, of course, is
          not the only restriction that might be in place. Just because CSP
          allows you to make <code>XMLHttpReqests</code> to
          <code>https://bank.example.com/</code> doesn't mean that the request
          will go through cleanly.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="sec-directives">Directives</h2>

      <p>This section describes the content security policy directives
      introduced in this specification.</p>

      <p>In order to protect against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), web
      application authors SHOULD include
      <ul>
        <li>both the <code>script-src</code> and <code>object-src</code>
        directives, or</li>

        <li>include a <code>default-src</code> directive, which covers both
        scripts and plugins.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In either case, authors SHOULD NOT include either
      <code>'unsafe-inline'</code> or <code>data:</code> as valid sources in
      their policies. Both enable XSS attacks by allowing code to be included
      directly in the document itself; they are best avoided completely.</p>

      <section>
        <h3><code>default-src</code></h3>

        <p>The <code>default-src</code> directive sets a default source list
        for a number of directives. The syntax for the name and value of the
        directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "default-src"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>Let the <dfn>default sources</dfn> be the result of <a
        href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the <code>default-src</code>
        directive's value as a source list</a>.</p>

        <p>To enforce the <code>default-src</code> directive, the user agent
        MUST enforce the following directives:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>script-src</li>
          <li>object-src</li>
          <li>style-src</li>
          <li>img-src</li>
          <li>media-src</li>
          <li>frame-src</li>
          <li>font-src</li>
          <li>connect-src</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If not specified explicitly in the policy, the directives listed
        above will use the <a href="#dfn-default-sources">default sources</a>.</p>
        <section class="informative">
          <h4>Usage</h4>
          <p><code>default-src</code>, as the name implies, serves as a default
          source list which the other source list-style directives will use as
          a fallback if they're not otherwise explicitly set. That is, consider
          the following policy declaration:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'</pre>

          <p>Under this policy, fonts, frames, images, media, objects, scripts,
          and styles will all only load from the same origin as the protected
          resource, and connections will only be made to the same origin. Adding
          a more specific declaration to the policy would completely override
          the default source list for that resource type.<p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src example.com</pre>

          <p>Under this new policy, fonts, frames, and etc. continue to be load
          from the same origin, but scripts will <em>only</em> load from
          <code>example.com</code>. There's no inheritance; the
          <code>script-src</code> directive sets the allowed sources of script,
          and the default list is not used for that resource type.</p>

          <p>Given this behavior, one good way of building a policy for a site
          would be to begin with a <code>default-src</code> of
          <code>'none'</code>, and to build up a policy from there that contains
          only those resource types which are actually in use for the page you'd
          like to protect. If you don't use webfonts, for instance, there's no
          reason to specify a source list for <code>font-src</code>; specifying
          only those resource types a page uses ensures that the possible attack
          surface for that page remains as small as possible.</p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3><code>script-src</code></h3>

        <p>The <code>script-src</code> directive restricts which scripts the
        protected resource can execute. The directive also controls other
        resources, such as XSLT style sheets [[!XSLT]], which can cause the
        user agent to execute script. The syntax for the name and value of
        the directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "script-src"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>The term <dfn>allowed script sources</dfn> refers to the result of
        <a href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the <code>script-src</code>
        directive's value as a source list</a> if the policy contains an
        explicit <code>script-src</code>, or otherwise to the
        <a href="#dfn-default-sources">default sources</a>.
        
        <p>If <code>'unsafe-inline'</code> is <strong>not</strong> in
        <a href="#dfn-allowed-script-sources">allowed script sources</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whenever the user agent would execute an inline script (either
          from a <code>script</code> element or from an inline event handler),
          instead the user agent MUST NOT execute script.</li>

          <li>Whenever the user agent would execute script contained in a
          <code>javascript</code> URI, instead the user agent MUST NOT execute
          the script. (The user agent SHOULD execute script contained in
          "bookmarklets" even when enforcing this restriction.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If <code>'unsafe-eval'</code> is <strong>not</strong> in
        <a href="#dfn-allowed-script-sources">allowed script sources</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of evaluating their arguments, both operator
          <code>eval</code> and function <code>eval</code>
          MUST throw a security exception. [[!ECMA-262]]</li>

          <li>When called as a constructor, the function <code>Function</code>
          MUST throw a security exception. [[!ECMA-262]]</li>

          <li>When called with a first argument that is non-callable (e.g.,
          not a function), the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/timers.html#dom-windowtimers-settimeout"><code>setTimeout</code></a>
          function MUST return zero without creating a timer.</li>

          <li>When called with a first argument that is non-callable (e.g.,
          not a function), the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/timers.html#dom-windowtimers-setinterval"><code>setInterval</code></a>
          function MUST return zero without creating a timer.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The term <dfn>callable</dfn> refers to an object whose interface
        has one or more <dfn>callers</dfn> as defined in the <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/WD-WebIDL-20101021/#idl-callers">Web
        IDL</a> specification [[!WEBIDL]].</p>

        <p>Whenever the user agent <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#fetching-resources">fetches</a>
        a URI (including when following redirects) in the course of one of the
        following activities, if the URI does not <a
        href="#matches-a-source-list">match</a> the <a
        href="#dfn-allowed-script-sources">allowed script sources</a>, the user
        agent MUST act as if it had received an empty
        <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.1">HTTP 400 response</a>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Requesting a script, such as when processing the
          <code>src</code> attribute of a <code>script</code> element or when
          processing the <code>Worker</code> or <code>SharedWorker</code>
          constructors.</li>

          <li>Requesting an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
          (XSLT) [[!XSLT]], such as when processing the
          <code>&lt;?xml-stylesheet?&gt;</code> processing directive in an XML
          document [[!XML11]], the <code>href</code> attributes on
          <code>&lt;xsl:include&gt;</code> element, or the <code>href</code>
          attributes on <code>&lt;xsl:import&gt;</code> element.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>object-src</code></h3>

        <p>The <code>object-src</code> directive restricts from where the
        protected resource can load plugins. The syntax for the name and value
        of the directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "object-src"
directive-value   = source-list
</pre>

        <p>The term <dfn>allowed object sources</dfn> refers to the result of
        <a href="#parse-a-source-list">parsing the <code>object-src</code>
        directive's value as a source list</a> if the policy contains an
        explicit <code>object-src</code>, or otherwise to the
        <a href="#dfn-default-sources">default sources</a>.

        <p>Whenever the user agent <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#fetching-resources">fetches</a>

          <h5>Usage</h5>

          <p>JavaScript offers a few mechanisms that directly connect to an
          external server to send or receive information.
          <code>EventSource</code> maintains an open HTTP connection to a server
          in order to receive push notifications, <code>WebSockets</code>
          open a bidirectional communication channel between your browser and a
          server, and <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> makes arbitrary HTTP requests
          on your behalf. These are powerful APIs that enable useful
          functionality, but also provide tempting avenues for data
          exfiltration.
          
          <p>The <code>connect-src</code> directive allows you to ensure that
          these sorts of connections are only opened to origins you trust.
          Sending a policy that defines a list of source expressions for this
          directive is straightforward. For example, to limit connections to
          only <code>example.com</code>, send the following header:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: connect-src example.com</pre>

          <p>All of the following will fail with the preceeding directive in

        <p>The <code>sandbox</code> directive specifies an HTML sandbox policy

        ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "sandbox"
directive-value   = token *( 1*WSP token )
token             = &lt;token from RFC 2616&gt;

        <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#forced-sandboxing-flag-set">forced sandboxing flag set</a>
        as the output. [[!HTML5]]</p>

        <section class="informative">
          <h5>Usage</h5>

          <p>HTML5 defines a
          <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-iframe-element.html#attr-iframe-sandbox"><code>sandbox</code> attribute</a>
          for <code>iframe</code> elements, intended to allow web authors to
          reduce the risk of including potentially untrusted content by imposing
          restrictions on that content's abilities. When the attribute is set,
          the content is forced into a unique origin, prevented from submitting
          forms, running script, creating or navigating other browsing contexts,
          and prevented from running plugins. These restrictions can be loosened
          by setting certain flags as the attribute's value.</p>

          <p>The <code>sandbox</code> directive allows any resource, framed or
          not, to ask for the same sorts of restrictions to be applied to
          itself.</p>

          <p>For example, a message board or email system might provide
          downloads of arbitrary attachments provided by other users. Attacks
          that rely on tricking a client into rendering one of these attachments
          could be mitigated by requesting that resources only be rendered in a
          very restrictive sandbox. Sending the <code>sandbox</code> directive
          with an empty value establishes such an environment:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: sandbox</pre>

          <p>More trusted resources might be allowed to run in an environment
          with fewer restrictions by adding <code>allow-*</code> flags to the
          directive's value. For example, you can allow a page that you trust
          to run script, while ensuring that it isn't treated as same-origin
          with the rest of your site. This can be accomplished by sending the
          <code>sandbox</code> directive with the <code>allow-scripts</code>
          flag:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: sandbox allow-scripts</pre>

          <p>The set of flags available to the CSP directive should match those
          available to the <code>iframe</code> attribute. Currently, those
          include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>allow-forms</code></li>
            <li><code>allow-same-origin</code></li>
            <li><code>allow-scripts</code>, and</li>
            <li><code>allow-top-navigation</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Note as well that, like the rest of Content Security Policy, the
          <code>sandbox</code> directive is meant as a defense-in-depth. Web
          authors would be well-served to use it <em>in addition to</em>
          standard sniffing-mitigation and privilege-reduction techniques.</p>

      <section>
        <h4><code>script-nonce</code> (Experimental)</h4>

        <p>The <code>script-nonce</code> directive restricts script execution
        by requiring the presence of the specified nonce on <code>script</code>
        elements. The syntax for the name and value of the directive are
        described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "script-nonce"
directive-value   = nonce
nonce             = 1*( &lt;VCHAR except ";" and ","&gt; )
</pre>

        <p>If the directive's value is empty, consists solely of whitespace, or
        contains invalid characters, let the <var>script nonce</var> be the empty
        string. Otherwise, let the <var>script nonce</var> be the directive's
        value, <a
        href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#strip-leading-and-trailing-whitespace">stripped
        of leading and trailing whitespace</a>.</p>

        <p>If the policy contains a <code>script-nonce</code> directive, the
        server MUST generate a fresh value for the <code>script-nonce</code>
        directive at random and independently each time it transmits a policy.
        This requirement ensures that the nonce value is difficult for an
        attacker to predict.</p>

        <p>When enforcing the <code>script-nonce</code> directive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Whenever the user agent would execute a script from a
            <code>script</code> element, the user agent MUST NOT execute
            the script unless the <var>script nonce</var> is non-empty, and
            that script element contains a <code>nonce</code> attribute whose
            value, after <a
            href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#strip-leading-and-trailing-whitespace">stripping
            leading and trailing whitespace</a>, is a case-sensitive match
            for the <var>script nonce</var>.</li>
            <li>Whenever the user agent would execute a script from an inline
            event handler, instead the user agent MUST NOT execute the
            script.</li>
            <li>Whenever the user agent would execute script contained in a
            <code>javascript</code> URI, instead the user agent MUST NOT execute
            the script.</li>
        </ul>

        <section class="informative">
          <h5>Usage</h5>
          <p>The <code>script-nonce</code> directive is intended to allow
          developers to strictly specify exactly which <code>script</code>
          elements on a page were intentionally included for execution. This
          is particularly useful when <code>'unsafe-inline'</code> is accepted
          as a valid <code>script-src</code> (though any site is better off
          avoiding inline script completely), but can also serve as a layer of
          protection against the execution of otherwise trusted resources in a
          context where they might be unexpected and potentially dangerous.</p>

          <p>Usage is straightforward. For <em>each</em> request, the server
          generates a unique value at random, and includes it in the CSP
          header:</p>

          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: script-nonce <em>random-value</em>;</pre>

          <p>This same value is then applied as a <code>nonce</code> attribute
          to each <code>script</code> tag that ought to be executed.</p>

          <pre>&lt;script src="/path/to/script.js" nonce="<em>random-value</em>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script nonce="<em>random-value</em>"&gt;
  alert("I execute! Hooray!");
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  alert("I don't execute. Boo!");
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

          <p>Note that the nonce's value is <em>not</em> a hash or signature
          that verifies the contents of the script resources. It's quite simply
          a random string that informs the user agent which scripts were
          intentionally included in the page.</p>

          <p><code>script</code> elements containing the proper nonce execute.
          <code>script</code> elements that don't, don't. Even if an attacker
          is able to inject markup into the protected resource, the attack
          will be blocked by the attacker's inability to guess the random
          value.</p>

          <h5>Interaction with the <code>script-src</code> directive</h5>
          <p>The <code>script-nonce</code> and <code>script-src</code>
          directives' restrictions on code execution are non-exclusive: script
          will not execute unless it satisfies <em>both</em> directives. For
          example, inline event handlers will not execute given the following
          policy:</p>
          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
                         script-nonce <em>nonce_value</em>;</pre>
          <p>The <code>script-src</code> directive allows
          <code>'unsafe-inline'</code>, but the event handler's execution is
          blocked by the presence of the <code>script-nonce</code>
          directive.</p>
          <p>Similarly, script will not be executed given the following
          policy:</p>
          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://cdn.example.com;
                         script-nonce <em>nonce_value</em>;</pre>
          <p>and the following <code>script</code> element:</p>
          <pre>&lt;script nonce="<em>nonce_value</em>" src="https://not.example.com/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
          <p>The nonce value matches, but the source isn't included in the
          <code>script-src</code> directive's source list. If the
          <code>script</code> element was loading script from
          <code>https://cdn.example.com/</code> instead, it would execute, as
          its execution would violate neither the <code>script-nonce</code> nor
          <code>script-src</code> directives.</p>
          <p>Finally, and potentially surprisingly, script will not be executed
          given the following policy:</p>
          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://cdn.example.com;
                         script-nonce <em>nonce_value</em>;</pre>
          <p>and the following <code>script</code> element:</p>
          <pre>&lt;script src="https://cdn.example.com/script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
          <p>The source matches the <code>script-src</code> directive's source
          list, but no nonce is present. Its execution would therefore violate
          the <code>script-nonce</code> directive's restrictions.</p>

        <h4><code>plugin-types</code> (Experimental)</h4>

        <p>The <code>plugin-types</code> restricts the set of plugins that can
        be invoked by the protected resource by limiting the types of resources
        that can be embedded.  The syntax for the name and value of the
        directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "plugin-types"
directive-value   = media-type-list
</pre>

        <p>The term <dfn>allowed plugin types</dfn> refers to the result of
        <a href="#parse-a-media-type-list">parsing the <code>plugin-types</code>
        directive's value as a media type list</a></p>

        <p>Whenever the user agent would instantiate a <a
        href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#plugin">plugin</a>
        to handle <var>resource</var> while enforcing the
        <code>plugin-types</code> directive, the user agent MUST instead act as
        though the plugin reported an error if any of the following conditions
        hold:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The plugin is embedded into the protected resource via an
            <code>object</code> or <code>embed</code> element that does not
            explicitly declare a <a
            href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#mime-type">MIME type</a>
            with a <code>type</code> attribute.</li>

            <li><var>resource</var>'s media type does not <a
            href="#match-a-media-type-list">match</a> the list of <a
            href="#dfn-allowed-plugin-media-types">allowed plugin media
            types</a>.</li>

            <li>The plugin is embedded into the protected resource via an
            <code>object</code> or <code>embed</code> element, and the media
            type declared in the element's <code>type</code> attribute is not
            a case-insensitive match for the <var>resource</var>'s media
            type.</li>

            <li>The plugin is embedded into the protected resource via an
            <code>applet</code> element, and <var>resource</var>'s media type
            is not a case-insensitive match for
            <code>application/x-java-applet</code>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that in any of these cases, acting as though the plugin reported an error
        will cause the user agent to display the <a
        href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#fallback-content">fallback
        content</a>.</p>

        <section class="informative">
          <h5>Usage</h5>
          <p>The <code>plugin-types</code> directive whitelists a certain set
          of MIME types that can be embedded in a protected resource. For
          example, a site might want to ensure that PDF content loads, but that
          no other plugins can be instantiated. The following directive would
          satisfy that requirement:</p>
          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: plugin-types application/pdf;</pre>
          <p>Resources embedded via an <code>embed</code> or <code>object</code>
          element delivered with an <code>application/pdf</code> content type
          would be rendered in the appropriate plugin; resources delivered with
          some other content type would be blocked. Multiple types can be
          specified, in any order. If the site decided to additionally allow
          Flash at some point in the future, it could do so with the following
          directive:</p>
          <pre>Content-Security-Policy: plugin-types application/pdf application/x-shockwave-flash;</pre>
          <p>Note that wildcards are not accepted in the
          <code>plugin-types</code> directive. Only the resource types
          explicitly listed in the directive will be allowed.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="informative">
          <h5>Predeclaration of expected media types</h5>
          <p>Enforcing the <code>plugin-types</code> directive requires that
          <code>object</code> and <code>embed</code> elements declare the
          expected media type of the resource they include via the
          <code>type</code> attribute. If an author expects to load a PDF, she
          could specify this as follows:</p>
          <pre>&lt;object data="<var>resource</var>" type="application/pdf"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</pre>
          <p>If <var>resource</var> isn't actually a PDF file, it won't
          load. This prevents certain types of attacks that rely on serving
          content that unexpectedly invokes a plugin other than that which the
          author intended.</p>
          <p>Note that <var>resource</var> will not load in this scenario even
          if its media type is otherwise whitelisted: resources will only load
          when their media type is whitelisted <em>and</em> matches the
          declared type in their containing element.</p>

        <h4><code>reflected-xss</code> (Experimental)</h4>
        <p>The <code>reflected-xss</code> directive instructs a user agent
        to active or disactivate any heuristics used to filter or block
        reflected cross-site scripting attacks. The syntax for the name and
        value of the directive are described by the following ABNF grammar:</p>
<pre>
directive-name    = "reflected-xss"
directive-value   = "allow" / "block" / "filter"
</pre>
        <p>A user agent with support for XSS protection MUST enforce this
        directive as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the value of the directive is <code>allow</code>, the user
          agent MUST disable its active protections against reflected cross-site
          scripting attacks for the protected resource.</li>
          <li>If the value of the directive is <code>filter</code>, the user
          agent MUST enable its active protections against reflected cross-site
          scripting attacks for the protected resource. This might result in
          filtering script that is believed to be reflected being filtered or
          selectively blocking script execution.</p>
          <li>If the value of the directive is <code>block</code>, the user
          agent MUST stop rendering the protected resource upon detection of
          reflected script, and instead act as though it received an empty
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10.4.1">HTTP
          400 response</a> for the protected resource itself.</li>

        <h4><code>report-uri</code></h4>

        <p>The <code>report-uri</code> directive specifies a URI to which the
        user agent sends reports about policy violation. The syntax for the
        name and value of the directive are described by the following ABNF
        grammar:</p>

<pre>
directive-name    = "report-uri"
directive-value   = uri-reference *( 1*WSP uri-reference )
uri-reference     = &lt;URI-reference from RFC 3986&gt;

      <h2>Examples</h2>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Sample Policy Definitions</h3>

        <p>This section provides some sample use cases and accompanying security policies.</p>

        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> A server wishes to load resources only
        form its own origin:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'</pre>

        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> An auction site wishes to load images
        from any URI, plugin content from a list of trusted media providers
        (including a content distribution network), and scripts only from a
        server under its control hosting sanitized ECMAScript:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *;
                         object-src media1.example.com media2.example.com *.cdn.example.com;
                         script-src trustedscripts.example.com</pre>

        <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Online banking site wishes to ensure that all of the content
        in its pages is loaded over TLS to prevent attackers from eavesdropping on insecure content
        requests:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: default-src https: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'</pre>

        <p>This policy allows inline content (such as inline <code>script</code> elements), use of
        <code>eval</code>, and loading resources over <code>https</code>.  Note: This policy does
        not provide any protection from cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.</p>

        <p><strong>Example 4:</strong> A website that relies on inline
        <code>script</code> elements wishes to ensure that script is only
        executed from its own origin, and those elements it intentionally
        inserted inline:</p>

        <pre>Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
                         script-nonce: <em>nonce_value</em>;</pre>

        <p>The inline <code>script</code> elements would then only execute if

        <h3>Sample Violation Report</h3>

        <p>This section contains an example violation report the user agent
        might sent to a server when the protected resource violations a sample
        policy.</p>

        <p>In the following example, the user agent rendered a representation
        of the resource <code>http://example.org/page.html</code> with the
        following CSP policy:</p>

<pre>default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.org/csp-report.cgi</pre>

        <p>The protected resource loaded an image from
        <code>http://evil.example.com/image.png</code>, violating the
        policy.</p>

        <pre>{
  "csp-report": {
    "document-uri": "http://example.org/page.html",
    "referrer": "http://evil.example.com/haxor.html",
    "blocked-uri": "http://evil.example.com/image.png",
    "violated-directive": "default-src 'self'",
    "effective-directive": "img-src",
    "original-policy": "default-src 'self'; report-uri http://example.org/csp-report.cgi"
  }

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) Parsing</h3>

        <p>The <code>style-src</code> directive restricts the locations from
        which the protected resource can load styles. However, if the user agent uses a
        lax CSS parsing algorithm, an attacker might be able to trick the user
        agent into accepting malicious "style sheets" hosted by an otherwise
        trustworthy origin.</p>

        <p>These attacks are similar to the <a
        href="http://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2009/12/generic-cross-browser-cross-domain.html">CSS
        cross-origin data leakage</a> attack described by Chris Evans in 2009.
        User agents SHOULD defend against both attacks using the same
        mechanism: stricter CSS parsing rules for style sheets with improper
        MIME types.</p>

        <h3>Violation Reports</h3>

        <p>The violation reporting mechanism in this document has been
        designed to mitigate the risk that a malicious web site could use
        violation reports to probe the behavior of other servers. For example,
        consider a malicious web site that white lists <code>https://example.com</code>
        as a source of images. If the malicious site attempts to load
        <code>https://example.com/login</code> as an image, and the
        <code>example.com</code> server redirects to an identity provider (e.g.,
        <code>idenityprovider.example.net</code>), CSP will block the request.
        If violation reports contained the full blocked URL, the violation
        report might contain sensitive information contained in the redirected URI,
        such as session identifiers or purported identities. For this reason, the
        user agent includes only the origin of the blocked URI.</p>

      <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>

      <p>The <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header is an end-to-end
      header.  It is processed and enforced at the client and, therefore,
      SHOULD NOT be modified or removed by proxies or other intermediaries not
      in the same administrative domain as the resource.</p>

      <p>The originating administrative domain for a resource might wish to
      apply a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header outside of the
      immediate context of an application.  For example, a large organization
      might have many resources and applications managed by different
      individuals or teams but all subject to a uniform organizational
      standard. In such situations, a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
      header might be added or combined with an existing one at a network-edge
      security gateway device or web application firewall.  To enforce multiple
      policies, the administrator SHOULD combine the policy into a single header.
      An administrator might wish to use different combination algorithms
      depending on his or her intended semantics.</p>

      <p>One sensible policy combination algorithm is to start by allowing a
      default set of sources and then letting individual upstream resource
      owners expand the set of allowed sources by including additional origins.
      In this approach, the resultant policy is the union of all allowed
      origins in the input policies.</p>

      <p>Another sensible policy combination algorithm is to intersect the
      given policies.  This approach enforces that content comes from a certain
      whitelist of origins, for example, preventing developers from including
      third-party scripts or content in violation of organizational standards
      and practices.  In this approach, the combination algorithm forms the
      combined policy by removing disallowed hosts from the policies supplied
      by upstream resource owners.</p>

      <p>Interactions between the <code>default-src</code> and other directives
      SHOULD be given special consideration when combining policies.  If none
      of the policies contains a <code>default-src</code> directive, adding new
      src directives results in a more restrictive policy.  However, if one or
      more of the input policies contain a <code>default-src</code> directive,
      adding new src directives might result in a less restrictive policy, for
      example, if the more specific directive contains a more permissive set of
      allowed origins.</p>

      <p>Using a more restrictive policy than the input policy authored by the
      resource owner might prevent the resource from rendering or operating as
      intended.</p>
